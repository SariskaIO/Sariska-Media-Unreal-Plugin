Web Camera plugin for unreal engine
===================================

A plugin that let's you use a web camera on Windows, using VideoInput library (direct show), Mac and IOS, using the AVFoundation Library and Android using the Android Camera API through JNI


## Features:
   - A widget component named 'WebCameraWidget' to view the camera feed from a User Interface Blue Print
   - An Actor Component named 'WebCameraComponent' to generate the texture and use it from any Actor
   - Both components allow to select the device, request a desired width and height and mirroring using a Global Shader

## How to use

1. The plugin was tested on Unreal 4.18.3
2. You can clone the repository to `<Game>/Plugins/` or if you want you can use git submodules to your own git repository. Alternatively, you can copy to the `Engine/Plugins/` if you wish to make the plugin available to all of your projects.
   > Do not forget to run UE4's `Generate Project Files` to account for these changes!
3. If you want to use the widget component you can follow the first two steps from the [Quick Start Tutorial](hhttps://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/UMG/QuickStart/2/index.html) but instead of create the text controls you can create a WebCameraWidget inside the Web Camera Category, inside the widget attributes you can choose requested width and height

4. If you want to use the actor component you'll need to do the following:
	- Create a material with a TextureSamplerParameter2D parameter

	- Create a blue print actor and add a Web Camera component

	 - Put inside the creation script the dynamic material creation and assign the web camera texture to the TextureSamplerParameter2D parameter

  	- When you're using the mobile version, is necessary to add inside the tick event of the actor the code to set the texture parameter again

	- For IOS is necessary to add the following line to the `Project Settings > IOS > Extra PList Data>Additional PList Data ` :
        `<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key><string>Camera is used for AR functionality</string>`

	  A sample material and a sample blue print actor are inside the Content folder

 5. The latest versions of OSX require the request to access to the camera, so this plugin won't work while in the editor, to be able to use the camera in the binary, the Resources folder inside WebCameraFeed⁩ ▸ ⁨Source⁩ ▸ ⁨WebCameraFeed⁩ needs to be copied to the {project name} ▸ ⁨Source⁩ ▸ {project name} folder to be able to include the info.plist with the camera permission
